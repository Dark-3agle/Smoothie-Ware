# Smoothie-Ware
Homing like Marlin
This is basically the code for moving endstops on smoothieware firmware just like in arduino Marlin Firmware.
I did this just so that my Printbed dosent get scratched while i keep changing boards from marlin (Arduino ) to Smoothieboard for testing and 
trying to adjust the printbed everytime is a bit of a hassle. Also since changing the homing motion wont have any adverse effects on the process and for 
my own luxary, I felt this was needed.
